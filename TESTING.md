## Responsiveness

I tested my deployed project across a variety of devices to ensure optimal responsiveness and a seamless user experience. Testing was done through a combination of Google Dev Tools and [Perfecto](https://www.perfecto.io/)

The results from these tests are shown in the table below:

## Lighthouse Audit

To ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and user experience, I conducted a thorough Lighthouse audit on all key pages of the Film Buzz project. Both desktop and mobile versions were rigorously tested, yielding impressive results that showcased high levels of responsiveness and usability. With most performance scores exceeding 70, the site demonstrated strong overall efficiency. Accessibility scores also saw significant improvement after the addition of ARIA labels to key link tags, enhancing navigation for users relying on assistive technologies.

The audit identified several opportunities for optimisation, including reducing the Largest Contentful Paint time, eliminating render-blocking resources, properly sizing images, and implementing more efficient caching policies. Additional recommendations involved serving images in next-gen formats, minimising unused CSS and JavaScript, and improving text compression. While these findings present valuable opportunities for further enhancing performance, no critical issues were identified, affirming the siteâ€™s reliability and user-friendliness.

These audits confirm that the Film Buzz website delivers a seamless and efficient experience across devices, achieving a balance between performance, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The table below summarises the audit results for each page, complete with screenshots for reference.

| **Bug**                          | **Location**                          | **Cause**                                                                                                                                     | **Solution / Fix**                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Environment variable not loading  | `settings.py` and `.env`             | Environment variables defined in `.env` were not being loaded into the project, likely due to missing or incorrect package usage.             | Fixed using `python-dotenv` package.                                                                                                                                          |
| Cloudinary Images not loading     | Media files (e.g., `/media/`)         | Cloudinary was not correctly syncing media files between the cloud and the local host, likely due to missing configurations or unsynced media directory. | Fixed by ensuring that the Cloudinary storage backend was properly configured in `settings.py` and syncing both media directories (local and cloud) to match.                 |
| Missing movies App dependency     | `watchlist/models.py`                 | The `Watchlist` model attempted to import the `Movie` model from a movies app that did not exist in the project, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. | Fixed by creating a `movies` app to define the `Movie` model.                                                                                                                |
| Comma Error in `INSTALLED_APPS`   | `settings.py` (`INSTALLED_APPS`)      | A missing comma after `'watchlist.apps.WatchlistConfig'` caused Django to concatenate the next entry (`'cloudinary'`), leading to an `ImportError`. | Fixed by adding a missing comma after `'watchlist.apps.WatchlistConfig'`.                                                                                                    |
| Duplicate slug causing IntegrityError | Watchlist `save` method             | The `slug` field was not dynamically ensuring uniqueness, causing an `IntegrityError` when duplicate slugs were generated.                   | Updated the `save` method to dynamically generate unique slugs by appending a counter to the base slug if a conflict is detected.                                             |
| Categories Not Displaying in Dropdown | Admin Panel: Blog > Posts > Add Post | No category instances existed in the database, causing the dropdown for categories to be empty.                                              | Manually added the predefined categories using the Categories section in the admin panel.                                                                                     |
| Comment not submitting to the database | `views.py`                         | Not linking Django form with `details.html`.                                                                                                 | Fixed by using `form.as_p` in `details.html` instead of `textarea`.                                                                                                          |
| CKEditor not loading              | `base.html`                           | CKEditor extra CSS and JavaScript files were not loading.                                                                                     | Used Jinja block templates to define `extra_css` and `extra_js`. Found the solution through [Reddit r/django](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/6z38c1/help_with_adding_javascript_to_django_templates/).                                                                 |
| List bullet points not displaying | `about.html`                          | Tailwind CSS overrides the default list style, so bullet points were not visible by default.                                                  | Added the `list-disc` class to the `<ul>` element to explicitly set the bullet points.
